				<div class="intro">
					<p>ES College welcomes applications from students across the United States and around the world. We’re looking for applicants who are committed to their studies and who will thrive in our community—a diverse mix of students with a wide variety of interests, talents and goals.</p>
					<p>Our decisions are not based solely on one aspect of your application. Rather, we review your essays, letters of recommendation, extracurricular involvements, and yes, those numbers like GPAs and standardized test scores. <a href=https://github.com/ymericson/>Each application</a> is read at least twice, including once by your regional dean. At the end of this process, our goal is to bring together a class of dynamic, diverse and academically engaged students.</p>
					<p>This portion of our website is here to provide you with resources, from application checklists to info on financial aid and scholarships. If a question arises that you can’t find the answer to, feel free to <a href=https://github.com/ymericson/>contact us</a> anytime.</p>
