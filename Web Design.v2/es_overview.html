							<p>Successful enrollment growth, in a constantly changing landscape, requires consistent multi-year Search efforts, data-driven targeting strategies and tested marketing tactics.  When these things happen simultaneously,  you will have the strongest chance of efficiently building institutional awareness, distinction and growth.</p>
							<p>Planning begins with a focus on the optimal strategy: identifying the right names at the right time for strongest impact.</p>
							<p>Evaluation of targeting strategy and planning is a year-round exercise.We’re constantly working on your behalf to understand impact of the changing list source landscape.</p><br>
							<h2>The Four Pillars of Enrollment Strategy</h2>
							<img src=img/fourpillars.png alt="FourPillars">
							<p>Expertise – Whether it’s new scoring, data mapping, release timing, major categories or statewide testing policies, our targeting analysts stay ahead of the list sources’ changes.</p>
							<p>Timing – Our team works around the clock to get your campaign deployed. When the names are released, we simply have no other competing priorities.</p><p>Fit – We work hard to understand who is most successful on your campus, because - above all – we want to encourage interest from a student who will thrive there.</p>
							<p>Analysis – We have a constant eye on your program’s performance, which allows us to make midstream adjustments to maximize your results. This empowers us to make strategic refinements so the campaigns can stay ahead of marketplace changes and best support your enrollment goals.</p>

							<h2>2017 Volume Summary & Opportunity Review</h2>
							<img src=img/volumeleftover2.png alt="VolumeContacted">
							<p>In 2017, ESC contacted 66% of all available names within strategy in both Senior and Junior/Sophomore Search. We took all Primary names available through January, and limited purchase in the Secondary market to hit contract volume. Most of the names left on the table in the Secondary market came from Southern US (MS, AL, GA, etc.)</p>

							<p>ESC's score bands were updated this year to take account for the new MAT/PMAT scale. Scores take account for Score Choice, which allows applicants to submit only their single best test score to prospective colleges.<p>
							<p>AT test scores follow a normal distribution. This means that student performance tends to cluster around the middle of the scale</p>
